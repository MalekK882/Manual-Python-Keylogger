# Manual-Python-Keylogger
A simple — maybe broken, keylogger in Python. Detects letter usage and records.

As said, this is a most likely working yet untested keylogger that records letters and adds them to a directory.
Not intended for malicious use.

Somewhat a work in progress, since I wanna add more functions sometime...
Made after watching a very inspring malware video, and viewing course examples.
Thanks to "Murtaza's Workshop"'s for explaining how Python can detect keys and how keys are manually added to a txt file.

NOTE: If using for pen testing or stealth, it is recommended to change the storage txt file's name from "keylogger" to 
something harder to detect like "wifi" or "Windows Setup".
